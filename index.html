                <h2>Here's a time line of Len Chandler's life:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Born in Akron, Ohio</li>
                    <li>He showed an early interest in music and began playing piano at age 8. Studying classical music
                        in his early teens</li>
                    <li> He eventually earned his B.A. in Music Education from the University of Akron, moved to New
                        York City, and received an M.A. from Columbia University.</li>
                    <li>By the early 1960s, Chandler began to get involved in the Civil Rights Movement. He sang at
                        demonstrations and rallies and won a reputation as a protest songwriter. One of his most
                        famous songs was "Beans in My Ears"</li>
                    <li>He also served as one of the original crew members of Seeger's CLEARWATER organization, working
                        to save the environment around the Hudson River Valley</li>
                    <li>One of Chandler's song entitled "Run Come See the Sun", was sung by Pete Seeger at the Sanders
                        Theater in Boston in the year 1980. This song had a repeated phrase, which built up the harmony
                        as well.</li>
                    <li>Chandler was also a performer in the traveling anti-war troupe F.T.A., which was organized by
                        Jane Fonda in 1971. With Holly Near and Rita Martinson, the group toured the United States
                        and bases throughout the Pacific Rim. The travels were filmed, however the documentary was
                        pulled from theatres a week after its release due to the controversy surrounding Fonda's visit
                        to Hanoi.</li>

                            ...
                            he
                            has been always trying to tell me to use more chords and sing a couple of songs in minor
                            keys..."</em>
